I do not own any music and images (and most of the code) here.

Original `readme`:
>  ludum-dare-28

>Our game for the Ludum Dare #28 jam

>Check out the [https://github.com/antila/ludum-dare-28/releases](releases "Releases") to see the version of the source submitted to the jam, since the source might have been changed since then. 

>Deployed version on github pages won't be updated to latest version until voting is over!
